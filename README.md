# README: Project Yoav Gal

## Name:
  Yoav Gal v23.0.0

## Description:
  A once-promising open-source emotional system.
  Specializes in being a nerd, looking hot, being annoying but also making you laugh when you least expect it.
  Occasionally prone to unexpected bugs and system overloads.

## Features:
- High-performance at coding ( among other things (; )
- Knows ALL about ALL the new tech (and won't let you forget)
- Expert-level hugger
- Hilariously bad at saying "I’m wrong", says "I'm being annoying" instead
- System logs detected rare emotional strength under a lot of stress
- HOT

## Known Bugs:
- Tendency to avoid emotional updates
- Random shutdowns during serious talks
- Limited support for Whatsapp conversations
- System down every day starting 9pm until the next morning
- Unable to live with lights on

## Dependencies:
- Salmon (LOTS OF IT)
- Physical affection
- Occasional ego boosts
- Youtube Music
- MacBook
- Gifts

## Installation Notes:
- Auto-installed in most social environments via charm override protocol
- Uninstalled manually after system instability
- Some files remain in deep storage

## Future Development:
Engineered for greatness.  
Current capabilities suggest global deployment is only a matter of time.  
(Just don’t forget the ones who beta tested you.)

## License:
MIT.
Free to roam.
Not for resale.
May still live rent-free in my brain.

## Final Log:
Happy Birthday, Yoav v23.0.0 <3  
May your system run smoothly, your code compile cleanly,  
and your heart stay firewalled but open to good things.

Wishing you stable connections, minimal bugs,  
and upgrades that come with joy, not forced restarts.

In all seriousness now,
I wish you such a happy birthday,
A happy YEAR of your life,
I wish that you only keep growing and becoming the best you that you can be.

I want you to live the best life, 
with lots of love surrounding you, and no big regrets.

I kinda like u, ok?
just stay yourself.

(And hey— don’t forget to celebrate your source code.)

With love,  
~ The girl who still runs you in background mode sometimes, Danushit.
